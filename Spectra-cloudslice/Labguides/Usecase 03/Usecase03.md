# Usecase 03 - Create a cross-department intelligent multi-agent automation solution

## Overview

Contoso, a growing global technology company, hires dozens of employees
every month across multiple regions. Their onboarding process involves
coordination between HR, IT, Facilities, Security, and Finance. Each
department uses different systems, and onboarding tasks are often
managed through email threads, spreadsheets, and manual follow-ups. This
leads to delays, missed steps, and a poor first-day experience for new
hires.

To modernize this process, Contoso adopts a **Multi-Agent AI Automation
framework** where specialized AI agents collaborate to orchestrate
onboarding tasks end-to-end.

analyze Request for Proposal (RFP) and contract documents. Reviewing
RFPs manually can take days and involves multiple stakeholders such as
legal, compliance, and business teams. With AI agents working together,
the system summarizes the document, identifies risks, and checks
compliance requirements - helping teams respond faster and more
accurately

1. Switch to **"RFP Team"** from the top left section and click **"Continue"** button.

multi-agent AI system to analyze Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and
other contract documents. Legal and compliance teams often spend
significant time reviewing contracts for risks, missing clauses, and
policy alignment. With AI agents collaborating, the system can quickly
summarize contracts, identify risks, and verify compliance with internal
standards.

This scenario highlights how AI supports faster, more consistent
contract reviews while keeping humans in control of final decisions.

1. Switch to the **"Contract Compliance Review Team"** from the
    top left section and click **"Continue"** button.

    **Agents Used:** Contract Summary, Contract Risk, Contract Compliance

    ![](./media/image92.png)

    The Contract Compliance Review Scenario allows users to explore and

      This structured approach ensures that users receive automated AI-coordinated task execution and intelligent responses from specialized agents.

      ![](./media/image96.png)    

## Summary

In this use case, Contoso leverages a Multi-Agent Accelerator solution
deployed on Azure to orchestrate employee onboarding. When HR initiates
a new hire request, AI agents collaborate to analyze requirements,
create a task plan, and coordinate actions across enterprise systems.

Specialized agents handle responsibilities such as account provisioning,
hardware allocation, access control, payroll setup, and compliance
verification. A planner agent breaks the goal into structured steps,
executor agents perform actions, and validation agents ensure
completeness and policy alignment - all while keeping humans in the loop
for approvals.

This implementation highlights how multi-agent AI orchestration
transforms a traditionally manual, error-prone HR process into an
intelligent, automated, and scalable workflow. The result is faster
onboarding, improved operational efficiency, and a better experience for
both employees and internal teams.
